=|:::Synchronous and Asynchronous:::|=
    1. JavaScript is SINGLE-THREADED
        -> JavaScript can do only ONE task at a time
        -> It uses one Call Stack
        -> It executes code top to bottom
    
    2. If JS does one thing at a time, how does it handle slow tasks?
        -> Synchronous & Asynchronous behavior
    
    1️⃣ Synchronous JavaScript (Blocking)
        -> Synchronous code blocks execution, while Asynchronous code allows long-running tasks to run in the background without blocking the main thread.
        -> Each task waits for the previous task to finish

        📌Big Problem with Synchronous Code
            ⛔ Browser FREEZES
            ⛔ Page becomes unresponsive

    2️⃣ Asynchronous JavaScript (Non-Blocking)
        Long tasks run in background
        JS continues executing other code

    🧠 JavaScript Runtime Parts (Very Important)
        1️⃣ Call Stack
            1. Where JS executes code
            2. Works LIFO (Last In, First Out)
        2️⃣ Web APIs
            1. Browser features
            2. Handle timers, fetch, DOM events
        3️⃣ Queue
            1. Stores callbacks
            2. Two types:
               1. Callback Queue (macrotask)
               2. Microtask Queue (promise)
        4️⃣ Event Loop
            1. Checks:
                1. Is Call Stack empty?
                2. If yes → push task from queue to stack

    ⚖️ Synchronous vs Asynchronous (Clear Table)
        Feature     | Synchronous   | Asynchronous
        Execution	| One by one	| Background tasks
        Blocking	| Yes           | No 
        Speed	    | Slow          | Fast
        UI Freeze	| Possible      |	No
        Example	    | Normal JS     |	setTimeout, fetch
